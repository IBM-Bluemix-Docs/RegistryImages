# Getting started with the `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` image
{: #ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network}

The `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` image contains tools for automating the configuration of Vyatta virtual router appliances within a Secure Perimeter.
{:shortdesc}

You can access the images that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} by using the command line, see [IBM public images](/docs/services/Registry/registry_public_images.html#public_images).
{: tip}

## How it works
{: #how-it-works}

With `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network`, you can automate the configuration of your Secure Perimeter's Vyatta virtual router appliance.

For more information about Secure Perimeter, see these blog articles:
  * [Set up a Secure Perimeter in IBM Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2018/ibm-cloud-vyatta-set-up-secure-perimeter/)
  * [Set up an automated Secure Perimeter in IBM Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2018/set-automated-secure-perimeter-ibm-cloud/).

You can use the `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` image in two ways:
-  Use `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` as a Docker container to initialize the Secure Perimeter firewall rules configuration.
-  Use `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` as a pod on a Kubernetes cluster to poll the IBM Cloud infrastructure account for new subnets created on your Secure Perimeter Segment VLANs and add them to the Vyatta firewall configuration.

## What is included
{: #whats_included}

The `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` image provides the following software packages.
{:shortdesc}

-   Alpine Linux
-   Python runtime
-   SoftLayer Python Client
-   Ansible

## Getting started
{: #how_to_get_started}

Review the following tasks to learn how to use `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network`:

1.  [Provision a Kubernetes cluster within a Secure Perimeter using {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}](#provision_cluster)
2.  [Run initial config of your Secure Perimeter Vyatta](#initial_setup)
3.  [Set-up as a Kubernetes pod within your Secure Perimeter](#setup)
4.  [config.json reference](#reference_config_json)
5.  [rules.conf reference](#reference_rules_conf)

## Provision a Kubernetes cluster within a Secure Perimeter by using {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
{: #provision_cluster}

1.  Provision your Kubernetes cluster from the **Containers** section in IBM Cloud catalog.
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Select the Secure Perimeter Segment public and private VLANs from the VLAN dropdown menus.
4.  Enter all other details as required.
5.  Click **Create Cluster**.

Review [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](/docs/containers/container_index.html#container_index) documentation about how to get access to your cluster after it has been deployed.

## Run initial config of your Secure Perimeter Vyatta
{: #initial_setup}

1. Create a file that is named _config.json_. This file contains the basic parameters needed by `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` to access the Vyatta.

  ```
  {
    "slid": "XXXX",
    "apikey": "XXXX",
    "region": "XXXX",
    "inf_name_private": "dp0bond0",
    "inf_name_public": "dp0bond1",
    "gatewayid": "XXXX",
    "vlans": [
      {
        "type": "XXXX",
        "vlan_num": XXXX,
        "vlanid": XXXX
      },
      ...
    ],
    "vyatta_gateway_vip": "X.X.X.X",
    "vyatta_primary": {
      "private_ip": "X.X.X.X",
      "public_ip": "X.X.X.X"
    },
    "vyatta_secondary": {
      "private_ip": "X.X.X.X",
      "public_ip": "X.X.X.X"
    }
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  See the [config.json reference table](#reference_config_json) for details about how to populate _config.json_. This file can also be used in the [set-up of `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` as a Kubernetes pod](#setup) process.

2. Run `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` as a Docker container to begin initial set-up.

  ```
  docker run registry.bluemix.net/ibm/ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network:1.0.0 python config-secure-perimeter.py -v /path/to/current/dir:/opt/secure-perimeter
  ```
  {: pre}

  This action creates a file _state.json_ in your working directory. This file is used in the [set-up of `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` as a Kubernetes pod](#setup).

## Set-up as a Kubernetes pod within your Secure Perimeter
{: #setup}

In order for `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` image to manage subnets on your Secure Perimeter, you can run it as a long-lived process using a Kubernetes pod. The `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` has several configuration files and folders that must be copied to the pod to configure it for the Vyatta:

1. Create a file that is named _pvc.yaml_. This configuration file creates a persistent volume claim (pvc) that you can mount to your pod as a volume.

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: network-pvc
    annotations:
      volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-bronze"
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Create the pvc.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f restore-pvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Create a file that is named _network-pod.yaml_. This configuration file deploys the `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` image as a pod in your Kubernetes cluster and mounts your persistent volume claim as a volume.

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: network-pod
    labels:
      app: network-pod
  spec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: network-pod
          image: registry.bluemix.net/ibm/ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network:1.0.0
          volumeMounts:
          - name: network-vol
            mountPath: /opt/secure-perimeter
        volumes:
        - name: network-vol
          PersistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: network-pvc
  ```
  {: codeblock}

4. Create a file that is named _rules.conf_. This configuration file tells `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` which external subnets and ports from the public internet to whitelist into the Secure Perimeter.

  ```
  {
      "external_subnets": [
        "X.X.X.X/X",
        "X.X.X.X/X"
      ],
      "external_ports": [
        "XX",
        "XX"
      ],
      "userips": [
        "X.X.X.X",
        "X.X.X.X"
      ]
  }
  ```
  {: codeblock}

5. Copy the files onto the `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` pod.

  ```
  kubectl cp keys network-pod:/opt/secure-perimeter/
  kubectl cp state.json network-pod:/opt/secure-perimeter/state.json
  kubectl cp config.json network-pod:/opt/secure-perimeter/config.json
  kubectl cp rules.conf network-pod:/opt/secure-perimeter/rules.conf
  ```
  {: pre}

  The directory _keys_ contains the SSH keys needed for `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` to access the Vyatta. See the [prerequisites section](#prerequisites) for more information about the SSH keys.

## Prerequisites
{: #prerequisites}

-   Vyatta and VLANs that have been ordered from IBM Cloud infrastructure portal and VLANs have been associated to the Vyatta.
-   The automated Secure Perimeter deployment pre-loads the Vyatta with SSH keys that `ibmcloud-secure-perimeter-network` uses to access the gateway. SSH keys must be loaded either manually or through the Secure Perimeter installation process. Review the article [Set up an automated Secure Perimeter in IBM Cloud ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2018/set-automated-secure-perimeter-ibm-cloud/) for more information.
